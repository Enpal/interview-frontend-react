# React Code Challenge

Welcome to our React Code Challenge. This code challenge was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Application

There are 3 pages available:

- Film List: List of popular movies
- Film Item: Detail of specific movie
- Favorites: List of movies which were set as favorites

We use the following API to retrieve the informations: [themoviedb.org](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).

## How to start

Install the required dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Run the project

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Tests

The Application has cypress as framework.

First start the application and then run the following:

```
npm test
```

We will look at the code together and see what we can change, fix or implement.
